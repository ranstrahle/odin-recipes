    <h1>Japanese Curry with Chicken Cutlet</h1>
    <img src="Katsu_Curry_7011b.jpg">
    <p>Katsu Curry is simply a rice and curry with a cutlet on it. Since the 
        cutlet is a meat dish on its own, my curry does not have any meat in it. 
        I added three vegetables in the curry that are commonly used to make a 
        Japanese Curry.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>House Vermont Curry (medium hot)</li>
        <li>Cooked rice</li>
        <li>Onion - sliced into 1cm wide pieces</li>
        <li>Potato - cut to 1.5cm cubes</li>
        <li>Carrot - sliced to 7mm pieces</li>
        <li>Chicken Cutlet - cut into 2.5cm strips</li>
        <li>Fukujunzuke as a condiment</li>
    </ul>        
    <ol>
        <li>Put oil into a pot and saut√© onion pieces until the edges start browning.</li>
        <li>Add potato and carrot pieces to the pot and stir.</li>
        <li>Add water and bring it to a boil. Remove scum as it rises.</li>
        <li>Add curry roux and cook.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken cutlets and slice them.</li>
        <li>Put cooked rice on one side of a serving plate, place cutlet pieces next to the rice.</li>
        <li>Pour curry on the side next to the cutlet away from the rice.</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of fukujinzuke on the plate.</li>
    </ol>
